Materials:

determine how object collides (bounce off, stick, etc)
determine effects played on collision

example:
	Source entity (projectile), material A
	Target entity (wall), material B

	source collides with target:
		source checks collision response table between material A and B
		spawns effect with source and target

		(should effects be mutual?)


Materials.tk:
	:MaterialResponse {
		physics info (refraction, reflection, blah) -- how does this work mutually?
		effects
	}

	Pairs of material responses, loaded into map, map creates bidi table of each material



physics responses:
	applies to both objects

	Source would respond with material B (target) responses
	Target would respond with material A (source) responses

e.g:
	Projectile: Material (brass)
	Wall: Material (steel)

	[brass steel] ->
		reflect until 65deg angle
		play sparks animation
		effect should play on both sides?
