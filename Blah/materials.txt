	Materials:

determine how object collides (bounce off, stick, etc)
determine effects played on collision

example:
	Source entity (projectile), material A
	Target entity (wall), material B

	source collides with target:
		source checks collision response table between material A and B
		spawns effect with source and target

		(should effects be mutual?)


Materials.tk:
	:MaterialResponse {
		physics info (refraction, reflection, blah) -- how does this work mutually?
		effects
	}

	Pairs of material responses, loaded into map, map creates bidi table of each material



physics responses:
	applies to both objects

Materials all stored in material files
material responses will be stored as list in material response file
Maps can specify one or more material response files to load material responses from
