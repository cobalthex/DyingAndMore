Proposed render system for game
===============================

Submit sprites, meshes, lines, etc to render system

Specify explicit passes (bound buffers, render targets, etc) -- barriers

dynamic vertex buffer built up and multiple textures bound and single draw call issued

instancing used, draw as many objects as possible under number of bounds slots. broken up by shader

apply all state at once (blend,raster,shader,etc)

render sort option?


Renders grouped by state, then texture
