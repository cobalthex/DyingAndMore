  ☐  Tkz format that uses gzip. Add serializer helpers to check for compression (based on header) and automatically run correct handlers

Bugs:
    ☐ Nine-patch relative clipping
    ☐ Evaluate [perf of] casting style args to correct type
    ☐ Fluids not clipping to map for partial tiles
    ☐ Spawner does not restart burp animation when still in fov
    ☐ Material interactions broken
    ☐ objects can collide with their children
    ☐ Render settings fucked after creating new map
    ☐ fluid delete broken (right click)
    ☐ dropdowns dont crop to screen correctly
    ☐ deleting squad attached to entity (spawner) may leave it orphaned, might cause unloadable level w/ unresolved reference
    ☐ visible bounds/content area pushed left
    ☐ Scrollboxes are incorrectly sizing child content

Conditions:
    ☐  Invisibility
    ☐  Invincibility

Game AI:
    ☐ Cover
    ☐ Waypoints
    ☐ Objectives/navpoints
    ☐ Cutscenes (maybe with some scripting)
    ☐ Events
    ☐ doors/devices
    ☐ marquee
    ✔  conditions/senses @done (20-09-10 18:32)
    ☐ enemies that attach to walls and affect map (rumbling, destruction, etc)
    ☐ ability to fully charge weapon
    ☐ Squad behaviors
      ☐ Flanking
      ☐ Provide cover (broadcasting between squad members)
    ☐ play animations
    ☐ flowfinding getting stuck in corners


Thrown abilities:
    ☐ shield
    ☐ health drain
    ☐ blinding light
    ☐ gravity sink

Gases:
    ☐  Behavior changing
    ☐  AI avoidance

  ☐  Variations for enemy skins

  ☐  serializer configurations (save these props under this configuration, etc)

  ☐  Fix pathfinding for non full tiles -- reevaluate post SDF

  ☐  tile patches in sectors. allows for destructable/modifyable tiles

  ☐  non destroying/pickupable projectiles (arrows)

  overhaul physics system:
    ☐ proper collidable shapes
    ☐ collision graph (necessary?) Dictionary<Collider, HashSet<Collider>>

Serializer:
    ☐ Implicit children (especially for UI elements (e.g. List { a: b; ... ; Child { }; Child { } } ))
    ☐ Parametric imports ($0 $1 $2 for arguments as templates)
    ☐ Hex inputs might not work (int.tryparse does not like 0x)

UI:
    ☐ default buttons (click enter in text box to submit)
    ☐ display scaling/transforms
    ☐ tab focus should not be able to escape modal
    ☐ when adding a modal to UI, should switch focus
    ☐ cache previous focus in modal?
    ☐ clipping in dropdown containers is not working at top (try dropdown with rows of colored boxes)
    ✔ SDF Fonts (can probably repurpose BitmapFont) @done (20-09-07 21:46)
    ✔ Accordian controls (particularly useful for AI) @done (20-09-07 21:47)
    ✔ Draggable window element @done (20-09-07 21:47)
    ☐ custom cursors
    ☐ animations
    ✔ BitmapFont text display element @done (20-09-08 10:45)
    ☐ Text Line-height based on baseline?
    ☐ Skip Press event and go directly to drag if mouse delta > some threshold?
    ☐ Store styles in Trie: Parent Child { } ... Styles[Child]->Styles[Parent] -- store composite
    ☐ TextInput android soft keyboard support (support on windows too?)
    ☐ Sounds (focus change/hover ?, click)
    ☐ Layout/measure bug w/ scrollbars: See right (units) side of Squad dialog
    ☐ scrolling sometimes causes scrollbox containers to zero (reflow issue it seems)
    ☐ Shift up/down for item list
    ☐ (Maybe?) Make InternalXChild functions fixed and Public API versions mutable
    ☐ InvalidateVisual
    ☐ separate Modal element?
    ☐ Recreate & reintegrate radial menu in editor

  ✔  Think only when alive? @done (20-04-10 22:48)

  ☐  Update cache hotloader to use Deserialize into object

  ☐  vehicles/turrets

  ☐  Displacement fx

  Trigger actions:
    ☐ block projectiles
    ☐ block line of sight
    ☐ block except projectiles (invisible?) -- block actors?
    ☐ solid wall
    ☐ nodraw (only draw if inside, trigger, blah)

  ☐ Don't hardcode file type paths (.ent.tk, .story.tk, etc)
  ☐ are configurations tied to game stories? (easy hard etc for single, vs ctf for multi)
  ☐ Game story should be genericized to support MP (level rotations)

  ☐ Dynamic render quality, esp for split screen



  ☐ GetTileCollisionTangent doesnt work. Also may be more efficient as GetNormal

  ☐ draw one extra sector of fluids?


  Music:
    ☐ background music (one track), play via FadeMusic game action
