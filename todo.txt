  ☐  Tkz format that uses gzip. Add serializer helpers to check for compression (based on header) and automatically run correct handlers

Bugs:
    ☐ Squad select scrollbox not sizing correctly
    ☐ Checkbox needs to clip check sprite
    ☐ Nine-patch relative clipping
    ✔ Sprite clipping in entity select @done (20-01-23 14:16)
    ☐ Evaluate [perf of] casting style args to correct type
    ☐ material interaction physics
    ☐ 'new Class' super slow

Conditions:
    ☐  Invisibility
    ☐  Invincibility

Game AI:
    ☐  Cover
    ☐  Waypoints
    ☐  Objectives/navpoints
    ☐  Cutscenes (maybe with some scripting)
    ☐  Events
    ☐  doors/devices
    ☐  marquee
    ☐  conditions/senses
    ☐  enemies that attach to walls and affect map (rumbling, destruction, etc)

Gases:
    ☐  Behavior changing
    ☐  AI avoidance

  ☐  Variations for enemy skins

  ☐  serializer configurations (save these props under this configuration, etc)

  ☐  Fix pathfinding for non full tiles

  ☐  tile patches in sectors. allows for destructable/modifyable tiles

  ☐  non destroying/pickupable projectiles (arrows)

  overhaul physics system:
    ☐  proper collidable shapes
    ☐  collision graph (necessary?) Dictionary<Collider, HashSet<Collider>>


Serializer:
    ☐ Implicit children
    ☐ Parametric imports ($0 $1 $2 for arguments as templates)

UI:
    ☐ default buttons (click enter in text box to submit)
    ☐ display scaling
    ☐ tab focus should not be able to escape modal
    ☐ when adding a modal to UI, should switch focus
    ☐ cache previous focus in modal?
    ✘ special modal element? @cancelled (20-01-23 14:00)

  ☐  Think only when alive?

  ☐  Update cache hotloader to use Deserialize into object

  ☐  vehicles/turrets

  ☐  Displacement fx

  Trigger actions:
    ☐ block projectiles
    ☐ block line of sight
    ☐ block except projectiles (invisible?) -- block actors?
    ☐ solid wall
    ☐ nodraw (only draw if inside, trigger, blah)

  ☐ Don't hardcode file type paths (.ent.tk, .story.tk, etc)
  ☐ are configurations tied to game stories? (easy hard etc for single, vs ctf for multi)
  ☐ Game story should be genericized to support MP (level rotations)

  ☐ Dynamic render quality, esp for split screen
  ✔ Pixel shader to draw tilemap (use tilemap as texture) @done (20-01-23 13:59)

  ✔ Falloff range for magnetism @done (20-01-23 13:59)

  ✔ update/render settings dialogs dont work when switching between modes @done (20-01-23 13:59)

  ☐ GetTileCollisionTangent doesnt work. Also may be more efficient as GetNormal

  ☐ draw one extra sector of fluids?


  Music:
    ☐ background music (one track), play via FadeMusic game action

 ☐ make polarinput actually polar (via radius, cap at 1)
